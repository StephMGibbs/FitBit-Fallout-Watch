# FitBit-Fallout-Watch
A watch face for FitBit watches that is in the style of a PipBoy from Fallout. I use the FitBit Versa 2 and wanted to create a custom Fallout-esque interface.

Built using FitBit SDK simulator, for a versa 3 device.

Steph1 branch works for versa3 devices uses fitbit sdk 6. The versa2 branch runs on fitbit sdk 4 so it can be used on versa2 and lower devices.
