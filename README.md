# FitBit-Fallout-Watch
A watch face for FitBit watches that is in the style of a PipBoy from Fallout. I use the FitBit Versa 2 and wanted to create a custom Fallout-esque interface.

Refrenced FitBit's site: https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/#:~:text=To%20customize%20your%20clock%20face,including%20images%20for%20specific%20platforms.

Using Node.js and NVM for windows to switch to Node version 14:

Built using FitBit SDK simulator, for a versa 3 device.
